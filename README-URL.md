Sorry, I deleted a template. But I really want to do a quick runaround on my project.

1. It works with all screen sizes(honestly i didn't try wider than 2000px, let's hope it will look good). You can try each one
2. It accepts links both with and without 'https://' mask
3. It has 3 error states: empty field, wrong website format, and the one when API returns 'undefined'
4. It uses localStorage to save your previous searches. Max value of displayed links is 10
5. You can copy link by clicking a button(it has a cool action script) or just click a link and go to a link target(if needed)
6. While in error state, you can delete whole input with one Backspace 'keydown', also it empties an input after a correct request

And some other small features that I forgot that I added

Would love to get feedback on GitHub, Frontend Mentor or X
